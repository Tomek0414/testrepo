# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# Objectives:
#     <br>List popular languages for Data Science
#     <br>List commonly used libraries for Data Science
#     <br>List Data Science Tools
#     <br>Show examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
#     <br>1. Python
#     <br>2. R
#     <br>3. SQL
#     <br>4. Julia
#     <br>5. Scala

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
#     <br>1. ggplot (R)
#     <br>2. caret (R)
#     <br>3. NumPy (Python)
#     <br>4. SciPy (Python)
#     <br>5. Pandas (Python)

# | PyCharm |

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[3]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[4]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
total_minutes = 200

hours = total_minutes // 60

minutes = total_minutes % 60

print(hours,':',minutes)
